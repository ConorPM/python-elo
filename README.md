# discord_elo
This program creates an elo database and updates it with users, results, and score.
Input is taken through a single bot command in Discord, which uses emoji reactions as additional input to verify results.

Discord bot token must be configured in config.py. For more information on setting up discord bots, see https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html
